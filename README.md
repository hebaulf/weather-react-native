# Weather Now

This project is a React Native app. Set up using [Expo](https://expo.dev/). I created a very simple weather app, using OpenWeather API, that displays on one screen the current weather at your location. For fun I created the logo from a Unicon icon and font using Figma, which you can see in the assets folder in this repo.

- Link for viewing in Expo Go app: [Expo Go Link]()[^1]
- A screen recording of the app in use througnh Simulator: [WeTransfer](https://we.tl/t-syan4yTPKa)
