# Weather Now

This project is a React Native app. Set up using [Expo](https://expo.dev/).  
I created a very simple weather app, using OpenWeather API, that displays on one screen the current weather at your location.  
For fun I created the logo from an Unicon icon and font using Figma.  
You can view the code here on Github.  
The live app is on Expo Go Apps but can only be viewed by invitation to the project.

[^1]: You will need to contact me, preferably on Slack, so I can invite you to the project via email.  
  And you will need to have your own Expo login with said email.
